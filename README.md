Welcome friends! This is the codebase for a fork of the Bluesky Social app -
Bluesky on Crack.

- [x] Constellation
- [ ] Add niche features
- [ ] Add ability to edit posts

## Development Resources

This is a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) application, written in the
TypeScript programming language. It builds on the `atproto` TypeScript packages
(like [`@atproto/api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atproto/api)), which are
also open source, but in
[a different git repository](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto).

There is a small amount of Go language source code (in `./bskyweb/`), for a web
service that returns the React Native Web application.

The [Build Instructions](./docs/build.md) are a good place to get started with
the app itself.

The Authenticated Transfer Protocol ("AT Protocol" or "atproto") is a
decentralized social media protocol. You don't _need_ to understand AT Protocol
to work with this application, but it can help. Learn more at:

- [Overview and Guides](https://atproto.com/guides/overview)
- [Protocol Specifications](https://atproto.com/specs/atp)
- [Bluesky's Blogpost on self-authenticating data structures](https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-6-2022-a-self-authenticating-social-protocol)

The app encompasses a set of schemas and APIs built in the overall AT Protocol
framework. The namespace for these "Lexicons" is `app.bsky.*`.

## Contributions

> Bluesky On Crack is a fork of Bluesky.. PRs are welcome!

**Guidelines:**

- Check for existing issues before filing a new one please.
- Stay away from PRs like...
  - Changing "Post" to "Skeet."
  - Refactoring the codebase, e.g., to replace React Query with Redux Toolkit or
    something.

## Forking guidelines

You have our blessing 🪄✨ to fork this application! However, it's very
important to be clear to users when you're giving them a fork.

Please be sure to:

- Change all branding in the repository and UI to clearly differentiate from
  Bluesky or Bluesky On Crack.
- Change any support links (feedback, email, terms of service, etc) to your own
  systems.
- Replace any analytics or error-collection systems with your own so we don't
  get super confused.

## Are you a developer interested in building on atproto?

Bluesky is an open social network built on the AT Protocol, a flexible
technology that will never lock developers out of the ecosystems that they help
build. With atproto, third-party integration can be as seamless as first-party
through custom feeds, federated services, clients, and more.
